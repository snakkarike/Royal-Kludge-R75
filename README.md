# ü•≥Thanks!
Thanks to [@irfan](https://github.com/irfanjmdn/), [sdk66](https://github.com/sdk66/) and [@iamdanielv](https://github.com/iamdanielv) for their work on R65.

## ‚å®Ô∏è New Keymap

I've updated the **default** keymap to work with the current source. It can be used as a starting point for customization.

I use `9 layers` for my changes, `keyboard.json` specifies that in the following section:

```json
"dynamic_keymap": {
    "layer_count": 9
}
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Compiling

You can now use QMK builder with the following command:

```shell
qmk compile -j 0 -kb rk/r75/custom -km custom
```

> the `-j 0` uses parallel build to speed it up a bit

qmk should generate a new bin file: `rk_r75_custom_custom.hex` in your qmk_firmware folder.

## üåê Using via

In order to use via, you may have to upload the [json specification](Custom%20VIA%20Layout.json), it can be found under the `extras` folder.

## ü•æ Bootloader and Clearing eeprom

To prevent accidental KB Bootloader triggers, I have it hidden under a layer.

- To reboot and `enter bootloader mode`:
  - hold `Fn`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `q` key
- To `clear eeprom`:
  - hold `Fn`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `z` key

## ‚≠ê Features

To use the features i use `Layer 1`
- hold `Fn`

While on `Layer 1`, you have the following available:

-  `Right Alt` + `Q` - triple tap `Q` to `enter bootloader mode`
- `Right Alt` + `Z` - triple tap `Z` to `clear eeprom`

- `N` - Toggle NKRO
- `Right Shift` + `T` - Toggle SOCD
- `Right Shift` + `F3` - Toggle Numpad Layer
- `Right Shift` + `F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8` - Toggle Layers 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
