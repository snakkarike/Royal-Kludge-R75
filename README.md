# 🥳Thanks!
Thanks to [@irfan](https://github.com/irfanjmdn/), [sdk66](https://github.com/sdk66/) and [@iamdanielv](https://github.com/iamdanielv) for their work on R65.

## ⌨️ New Keymap

I've updated the **default** keymap to work with the current source. It can be used as a starting point for customization.

I use `9 layers` for my changes, `keyboard.json` specifies that in the following section:

```json
"dynamic_keymap": {
    "layer_count": 6
}
```

## 🖥️ Compiling

You can now use QMK builder with the following command:

```shell
qmk compile -j 0 -kb rk/r65/iamdanielv -km iamdanielv
```

> the `-j 0` uses parallel build to speed it up a bit

qmk should generate a new bin file: `rk_r65_iamdanielv_iamdanielv.bin` in your qmk_firmware folder.

## 🌐 Using via

In order to use via, you may have to upload the [json specification](extras/rk_r65_via.json), it can be found under the `extras` folder.

## 🥾 Bootloader and Clearing eeprom

To prevent accidental KB Bootloader triggers, I have it hidden under a layer.

- To reboot and `enter bootloader mode`:
  - hold `Fn`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `q` key
  - OR hold `RAlt`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `q` key
  - OR hold `CAPS Lock`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `q` key
  - OR hold `RAlt`, then double tap `PgDn`, then triple tap the `q` key
- To `clear eeprom`:
  - hold `Fn`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `z` key
  - OR hold `RAlt`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `z` key
  - OR hold `CAPS Lock`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `z` key
  - OR hold `Ralt`, then double tap `PgDn`, then triple tap the `q` key
